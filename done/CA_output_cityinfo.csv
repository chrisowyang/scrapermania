Kotlikoff, Daniel E. Smith - Google Books","For anyone with an interest in pensions—workers and employers, personnel directors, accountants, actuaries, lawyers, insurance agents, financial analysts, government officials, and social scientists—this book is required reading. Now, without the aid of a pension specialist, anyone can determine how their particular pension plan stacks up against the average. Using virtually all available government sources (including computerized data unavailable in print) and their own extensive surveys, the authors present a comprehensive description of the structural features and financial conditions of U.S. private, state, city, and municipal pension plans. The introductions to the hundreds of tables explain and  highlight the information.  The picture that emerges of the ""typical"" plan and its significant variations is crucial to all those with a financial stake in pensions. The reader can compare pension vesting, retirement, and benefit provisions by plan type, plan size, industry, union status, and many more characteristics. With this information, workers can evaluate just how generous their employer is; job applicants can compare fringe benefits of prospective employers; personnel directors can judge their competitive edge.  The financial community will find especially interesting the analysis of the unfunded liabilities of private, state, and local pension funds. The investment decisions of private and public pension funds and their return performances are described as well.  Government officials and social scientists will find the analysis of pension coverage, the receipt of pension income by the elderly, cost-of-living adjustments, and disability insurance of special importance in evaluating the proper degree of public intervention in the area of old age income support.  Pensions in the American Economy is comprehensive and easy to use. Every reader, from small-business owners and civil servants to pension fund specialists, will find in it essential information about this increasingly important part of labor compensation and retirement finances.",Pensions in the American Economy,0,0.85,0.31,0,156,1297,47,7,4656,377

Okay, so first off I know that cheap, and Southern California don&#39;t go together. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking what is the *most* affordable, neighborhood/city(of course staying out of the bad areas).  Putting aside the cost of moving and buying a house, what are the living expenses like?(please no answers like, &quot;too expensive!&quot;).  Whats an average electric/gas/water bills like for two people in a two bedroom house?  Everyone says traffic is ridiculous there but I went and stayed in Los Angeles for a week in various areas, driving most of the time we were there, and the only time we got stuck in traffic was Friday night in downtown Santa Monica near the beach. I&#39;ve also looked at ads from the grocery stores and I don&#39;t see a HUGE difference in price. As for gas, we both have economical vehicles(one of those being a motor scooter), I expect the gas to be 30-40 cents more a gallon, is that about right?. . So basically I&#39;m asking two main questions. . 1. Where is the most affordable place to live in Southern California(within an hour from LA or SD) while still living in a safe neighborhood?. . 2. What is the biggest expense of living in California? . . We really want to move there, we understand it will be different and difficult, but we are willing to put forth the effort and struggle to start off.  Please only constructive answers, don&#39;t just say &quot;don&#39;t do it&quot;.. . Thanks so much in advance for your help!",          What is the most affordable place to live in Southern California?      ,0.87,4.05,0.87,0.87,25,227,48,37,2185,1832

We have 2 small children, 3 and 1 and eventually will like them to go to a private school (christian if possible). I am an Occupational therapist and my husband is a CPA... We will need a great area in Naples where we can raise our children. We like quite, older people to tell you the truth, even though we are in our early 20's we like to hang out with mature people. we love to go to church and be in church activities. we are way far from being party people... We would like a nice home, in a nice area. We dont mind if its close to the beach or not. we mainly look for safety. I would like to have good grocery stores around, and good parks for my kids. We have heard that North Naples is a nice area, is there any others? good quite places? areas to raise your family? I would love as many comments as possible.

In some ways, they document the end of an era. The photographs show no automobiles, only carts. A long line of horses stands in the sun outside the French Market; by November of 1910, a shelter for horses driven by farmers to and from market would open nearby on Ursulines Street. A man in a white shirt is just visible through the doorway at the famous restaurant Begue's, at Madison and Decatur streets, perhaps mixing drinks. (The location is Tujague's today.)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There are streetcar tracks on Toulouse and Royal streets. Cisterns used to collect water stand in the courtyards of homes. A pair of fashionable women chat outside the French Opera House; it would burn down in 1919. But other things seem little changed. Shoppers and vendors bargain at the market. A couple sits on a stoop. Businesses abound: antique shop, a laundromat, a bar room, a plumbing shop. The photos' provenance is unclear.
